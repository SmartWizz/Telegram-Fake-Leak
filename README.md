# Telegram Phishing Leak

## About <a name = "about"></a>
This is a fake page for telegram that steals telegram web session.<br>
Upon logging into the fake telegram site via phone number or QR, the session will be sent to your discord webhook, then the user is redirected to the real Telegram login page.<br>

Edit the index.html and put your webhook into the webhook variable at the bottom of the page.
